**Agenda**

1. **Meeting Cadence:** Participants discussed the suitability of weekly meetings in terms of timing and process for any ad-hoc meetings for urgent decisions.
2. **Service Account Ownership:** The call addressed service account ownership, clarifying that the service account is not owned but operationally supported by the Governance Working Group.
3. **Existing Priorities - Node Selection:** The group discussed criteria for selecting new nodes, including previous network experience (on Flow or other networks), participation and contributions to the ecosystem, resources available for self-staking (versus third-party reliance), co-marketing opportunities, dedicated personnel to handle node operations, etc. It was decided that some would be required fields while others will have weighted scoring. The precise methodology will be developed by the group and shared with the community for feedback.
4. **Quantnode’s interest in running a node:** Specific attention was given to the issue of Quantnode and their request to become a node operator, with a discussion of their qualifications.
5. **On-Chain Voting Need:** Participants considered whether on-chain voting was necessary and evaluated the costs and benefits of such a feature.
6. **Discussion on Cast Tool:** The group delved into a detailed discussion on the necessity of the Cast tool and whether it aligns with community requirements.
7. **Next Agenda:** The meeting concluded with a preview of the next agenda, which includes addressing existing issues, node selection, working group's role, and efforts to restore community confidence.

**Key Decisions**

1. Quantnode was approved to run a Verification Node; the same has been communicated to them.
2. Resources are crucial and limited and spending them on making Cast an on-chain voting tool can be delayed; this was based on an understanding of similar market offerings like snapshot which also store votes off-chain (like Cast)
3. Node selection criteria was laid out at a high level. The final draft will be created and shared by the Flow core team soon and presented to the GWG for final approval.
